Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

	Routers and 'teaching' express to use JSON.

Describe Middleware?

	Middleware is software that runs between the request and response.

Describe a Resource?

	A resource is data with a set of methods that operate on it. In our use cases, so far, 
	it has been data stored in a database, where we wrote endpoints using HTTP methods to manipulate.

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?
	
	Data would be my first thought. Status messages are very helpful as well.

How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

	By using routers.
